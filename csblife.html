New Roles , New Routines , New Relationships and New Assumptions in my Life. 

Seriously , I really don't know where to start this essay , homework or whatever it is. Well, It's really hard to accept that I'm too far away from my hometown, High School friends, Parents,my pet and other things that I love.
It's really hard,  yes it is,but i have to accept it. i'm no longer a high school student,i should have move on from now.

To tell you the truth, I'm a "promdi-girl" , i used to live in Batangas and it's hard to let go of my "Puntong Batangueno" , im in college now,i have to remove those wordsthat only Batanguenos can understand.
My mother is my alarm clock.  She always wake me up around 5 am when i was in high schoolwith her sweet loud voice saying " Bunso , gising na, Aba , ANDINE na ang service mo, hindi ka na naman makakakain.", 
but now, my mother is too far away from me, it's kinda sad and my alarm clock now is Miley Cyrus singing " I'll Always Remember You",  while miley is singing, i imagine my mother saying those words to me. I had my service
every morning when i was in high school, but now in college, my transportatin is just walking. Walking is now part of my daily Exercise.

They Say College is more easier that High School. i better find it out by myself. Soon.

I have now my new friends, my blockmates! also known as GD1U. im happy with them but still we cannot change the fact that we miss our high school friends.
i know my friends in high school will be my friendsforever. and all i wish for college is to have true friends  that will help me build our friendship more stronger.

My English Instruction Specialist once told me "it's time to move on charm, nakakita ka na ba ng bonsai? hindi siya makaabot sa langit, give yourself time to grow and reach up to the sky."
i guess he's right. He's definitely , Absolutely Right! i have to give time to grow and remove all the bad habits, childhood attitudes and act like a Future Game Developer and Reach up to the Sky!

I have to study more and more and more and more (10,000 times) for this course! Rock and Roll! :)
